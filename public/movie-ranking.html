<h1>The Best Movies According to Arjun</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>INTESTELLAR</h3>
<p>Absolute cinema.<br>The visuals,the soundtracks,the storyline is just phenomenal.Very wholesome and emotionally involving masterpiece of Nolan</p>
<h3>HAWKSAW RIDGE</h3>
<p>The most moving film ive ever seen.literally cried throughout the film.<br>Based on a true stroy of a man who is convicted by his faith to do the right things in the midst of all odds.<br>A brimming message straight from the gospel "Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good"</p>
<h3>INCEPTION</h3>
<p>Brain food film.Another ingeneous masterpiece of Nolan that even gets us into a limbo.</p>
